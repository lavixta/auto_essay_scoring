# auto_essay_scoring
this is my first project to imploy machine learning into scoring users writting 
it has 2 input:
first input : question ==> we then use machine learning to filtrate the approximately matched question for easier to score the answer 
second input : answer ==> which then we tokenize, apply BERT to score the answer base variety of criteria
